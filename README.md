# workbox-website-project
My first php project made to practice real work experiance.

The idea behind it is to make a website to assisst workers in different sectors.

I developed the back-end using PHP and MySQLI.
main features:
    Login page with privileged accounts.
    Email authentication.
    Password hashing.
    Input sanitizing to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

I took free front-end template and modified it to serve what I want.

how to try it?
1- extract the the rar file.
2- but it in xampp htdocs.
3- open php my admin and include the database provided inside the file.
4- try to signup (only managament and IT are usable they are enough to get the Idea. If you try others that I did not builed you'll have errors.).

After login try also to give suggestion it will be stored in the data-base.

WARNING: DO NOT TRY OTHER SECTORS WHEN SIGNING UP AS I MENTIONED.
